	The key to any successful cooperative test is trust. \\
	And as our data clearly shows, humans cannot be trusted. \\
	The solution: robots! […] \\
	Creating a foundation of mutual respect, \\
	reinforced by the simulated bonds of artificial friendship. […] \\
	And finally, we put that trust to the test. \\
	Bam! Robots gave us six extra seconds of cooperation. \\
	Good job, robots.} \\ \medskip
